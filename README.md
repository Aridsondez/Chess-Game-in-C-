## Features
SFML Library: Utilizes the SFML library for graphics rendering and user input handling.
Object-Oriented Approach: Although initially attempted, due to constraints with the SFML window, the implementation may not be strictly object-oriented.
Makefile: Included Makefile for building the project (note that it might need adjustments for different systems).
## How to Use
Compile: Use the provided Makefile to compile the source code. You may need to adjust it according to your system configuration.
Type 'make' in the terminal. Note: *SFML files must be in the same directory. The frameworks, include files, and libraries.
